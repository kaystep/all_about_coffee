All About Coffee is a full stack web application built with Ruby on rails.
The idea for the project came about because many small independent roasters 
don't have reviews for their coffee online. Since coffee is something I love
and enjoy everyday I decided to build a web application that allows users to
login and review different coffees that they've tried. In addition to this
users can follow other coffee addicts in a Twitter-like status feed.

Languages/Framworks used for the project include:
  Ruby on Rails
  HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
  Javascript
  SQL
  Heroku
  AWS
  RESTful and MVC architecture
